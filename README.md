# Kilogram Converter
The goal of this project is to create a working Android version of a kilogram to pound converter for powerlifters and anyone who finds kilogram conversions useful. I would like to extend this to have a more display feel that shows the number of plates loaded on the bar at any given time. Furthermore, I would like to add a feature to switch between kgs->lbs and lbs->kgs.
