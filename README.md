# Powerlifting Calculator
The goal of this project is to create a working Android version of a kilogram to pound converter for powerlifters and anyone who finds kilogram conversions useful. I would like to extend this to have a more display feel that shows the number of plates loaded on the bar at any given time. Furthermore, I would like to add a feature to switch between kgs->lbs and lbs->kgs.

MainActivity.java is in the path: app/src/main/java/com/example/kilogramconverter
main_activity.xml is in the path: app/src/main/res/layout/main_activity.xml

App can be found in the Google Play Store at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=powerlifting.calculator.kilogramconverter
